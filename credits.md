What is Lagoon road
Lagoon road is a package/methodology that takes middleware to the extreme. It turns everything, from your templates, DOM events, API calls, whatever you can think of into a middleware function.

All this middleware is connected to what we call the (Lagoon) road. A single object where you chain your middleware regardless of the environment you are running in, being it the client, web server, api server, Raspberry Pie or mobile device. The benefit of this is that it becomes very easy to reason about the flow of your application. There is only one place that calls your middleware, the Lagoon road.

Because of this centralized system it additionally becomes very easy to share your middleware, routes or api calls on the client and web server for example. Login checks and data preparations on an api server and web server. Sharing code becomes a breeze even if you scale up your app.

Lagoon is not a monolithic framework that can do everything out of the box. At the core it is a simple package with only 250 lines of code. You can add extension (regular npm packages) to mold it in a system that works for you and your team.

Some of the laid back features of Lagoon road:

It is modular, don't like a package, switch it for something else, it is all just npm packages, so plug and play the way you like
Websockets, HTTP(2), you can switch protocolS without having to change the way you build your app
Plug in any store you like, you are not tied down to a single choice, you can even run multiple next to each other
Share code between environments and keep it organized, even when you scale up
Want to hook up a Raspberry Pie or Arduino, sure thing, you can check for changes on sensory output and feed it straight into an api server, web server or straight to the browser
You know how middleware works? You are up and running for Lagoon road, no endless docs you have to plow through

- Which version of node is supported?
- Does a single road not create overhead in other environments?
- What is the best directory structure for my project
